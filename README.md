# Reko: Your Personalized Music Recommendation App üéµ

Welcome to Reko, a music recommendation application that is driven by the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model. Reko is designed to cater to your musical needs by generating song suggestions based on your unique input. Whether you're in a particular mood, experiencing a specific feeling, or have a specific musical inquiry, Reko is designed to serve you. It not only provides a curated list of songs that match your criteria but also allows you to listen to previews, access the songs on Spotify, and like songs to improve future recommendations.

## Key Features üåü

- **Personalized Song Recommendations üéº** - Reko leverages the power of GPT-3 to generate song recommendations tailored to your mood, feeling, or specific query.

Reko is built with a modern tech stack that includes:

- **React.js** - A powerful front-end library for building interactive user interfaces.

- **Next.js** - A robust framework for server-rendered or statically exported React applications.
